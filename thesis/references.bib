	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

            Near-term quantum computers will have limited numbers of qubits and will only be able to reliably perform limited numbers of gates. Therefore, it is crucial to identify applications of quantum processors that use the fewest possible resources. We argue that simulating the time evolution of spin systems is a classically hard problem of practical interest that is among the easiest to address with early quantum devices. We develop optimized implementations and perform detailed resource analyses for several leading quantum algorithms for this problem. By evaluating the best approaches to small-scale quantum simulation, we provide a detailed blueprint for what could be an early practical application of quantum computers.
          , 
            With quantum computers of significant size now on the horizon, we should understand how to best exploit their initially limited abilities. To this end, we aim to identify a practical problem that is beyond the reach of current classical computers, but that requires the fewest resources for a quantum computer. We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, using diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice. Our circuits are orders of magnitude smaller than those for the simplest classically infeasible instances of factoring and quantum chemistry, bringing practical quantum computation closer to reality.},

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

            Free radicals play a vital role in all kinds of biological processes including immune responses. However, free radicals have short lifetimes and are highly reactive, making them difficult to measure using current methods. Here, we demonstrate that relaxometry measurement, or T1, inherited from the field of diamond magnetometry can be used to detect free radicals in living cells with subcellular resolution. This quantum sensing technique is based on defects in diamond, which convert a magnetic signal into an optical signal, allowing nanoscale magnetic resonance measurements. We functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) to target single mitochondria within macrophage cells to detect the metabolic activity. In addition, we performed measurements on single isolated mitochondria. We were able to detect free radicals generated by individual mitochondria in either living cells or isolated mitochondria after stimulation or inhibition.},

              28
              Si, where donors are local-area-implanted in a nanoscale MOS device. Despite robust single qubit gates, realising two-qubit exchange gates using this technique is challenging due to the statistical nature of the dopant implant and placement process. In parallel a precision scanning probe lithography route has been developed to place single donors and donor molecules on one atomic plane of silicon with high accuracy aligned to heavily phosphorus doped silicon in-plane gates. Recent results using this technique have demonstrated a fast (0.8 ns) two-qubit gate with two P donor molecules placed 13 nm apart in

              Coupling spin qubits to electric fields is attractive to simplify qubit manipulation and couple qubits over long distances. Electron spins in silicon offer long lifetimes, but their weak spin-orbit interaction makes electrical coupling challenging. Hole spins bound to acceptor dopants, spin-orbit–coupled
              J
              = 3/2 systems similar to Si vacancies in SiC and single Co dopants, are an electrically active spin system in silicon. However,
              J
              = 3/2 systems are much less studied than
              S
              = 1/2 electrons, and spin readout has not yet been demonstrated for acceptors in silicon. Here, we study acceptor hole spin dynamics by dispersive readout of single-hole tunneling between two coupled acceptors in a nanowire transistor. We identify

              = 3/2 energy spectrum. We find regimes of spin-like (+3/2 to −3/2) and charge-like (±1/2 to ±3/2) relaxations, separated by a regime of enhanced relaxation induced by mixing of light and heavy holes. The demonstrated control over the energy level ordering and hybridization are new tools in the

	abstract = {The essential insight of quantum error correction was that quantum information can be protected by suitably encoding this quantum information across multiple independently erred quantum systems. Recently it was realized that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes. These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are generalizations of Shor's original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the number of stabilizer measurements needed in their error recovery routines.},

These techniques are based on rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction. Separating and later recombining a singlet spin state provided a measurement of the spin dephasing time,

              2
              *, of ∼10 nanoseconds, limited by hyperfine interactions with the gallium arsenide host nuclei. Rabi oscillations of two-electron spin states were demonstrated, and spin-echo pulse sequences were used to suppress hyperfine-induced dephasing. Using these quantum control techniques, a coherence time for two-electron spin states exceeding 1 microsecond was observed.},

	abstract = {Most future quantum devices, including quantum computers, require control that is broadband, meaning that the rate of change of the time-dependent Hamiltonian is as fast or faster than the dynamics it generates. In many areas of quantum physics, including quantum technology, one must include dissipation and decoherence induced by the environment. While Markovian master equations provide the only really efficient way to model these effects, these master equations are derived for constant Hamiltonians (or those with a discrete set of well-defined frequencies). In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A 73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovian master equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despite apparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations are routinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs is likely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulations of two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtain quantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian master equations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, we find that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Master equations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies and bandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transition frequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as large as the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does not overlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accurate descriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomic systems.},

            Spin qubits based on shallow donors in silicon are a promising quantum information technology with enormous potential scalability due to the existence of robust silicon-processing infrastructure. However, the most accurate theories of donor electronic structure lack predictive power because of their reliance on empirical fitting parameters, while predictive ab initio methods have so far been lacking in accuracy due to size of the donor wavefunction compared to typical simulation cells. We show that density functional theory with hybrid and traditional functionals working in tandem can bridge this gap. Our first-principles approach allows remarkable accuracy in binding energies (67 meV for bismuth and 54 meV for arsenic) without the use of empirical fitting. We also obtain reasonable hyperfine parameters (1263 MHz for Bi and 133 MHz for As) and superhyperfine parameters. We demonstrate the importance of a predictive model by showing that hydrostatic strain has much larger effect on the hyperfine structure than predicted by effective mass theory, and by elucidating the underlying mechanisms through symmetry analysis of the shallow donor charge density.},

We account for factors that are normally ignored such as noise, the need to make repeated attempts, and the spacetime layout of the computation. When factoring 2048 bit RSA integers, our construction's spacetime volume is a hundredfold less than comparable estimates from earlier works (Van Meter et al. 2009, Jones et al. 2010, Fowler et al. 2012, Gheorghiu et al. 2019).

The gain is most prominent in realistic cases, where the qubits are not all mutually coupled. Thus the shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls \{{\textbackslash}em vs\} non-local (\{{\textbackslash}em i.e.\} coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown, time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the usual gate complexity. In the limit of fast local controls (as \{{\textbackslash}em e.g.\} in NMR), time-optimised realisations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply controlled \{{\textbackslash}sc not\}-gate (\{{\textbackslash}sc c\${\textasciicircum}\{n-1\}\$not\}) in various coupling topologies of \$n\$ qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the quantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard and \{{\textbackslash}sc swap\} gates, while the \{{\textbackslash}sc c\${\textasciicircum}\{n-1\}\$not\}-gate for completely coupled network of six qubits is nearly seven times faster.},

	abstract = {Atomic-scale control of multiple spins with individual addressability enables the bottom-up design of functional quantum devices. Tailored nanostructures can be built with atomic precision using scanning tunneling microscopes, but quantum-coherent driving has thus far been limited to a spin in the tunnel junction. Here we show the ability to drive and detect the spin resonance of a remote spin using the electric field from the tip and a single-atom magnet placed nearby. Read-out was achieved via a weakly coupled second spin in the tunnel junction that acted as a quantum sensor. We simultaneously and independently drove the sensor and remote spins by two radio frequency voltages in double resonance experiments, which provides a path to quantum-coherent multi-spin manipulation in customized spin structures on surfaces.},

In order to find someone's phone number with a 50\% probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

@article{hill_exchange-based_2021,
	title = {An exchange-based surface-code quantum computer architecture in silicon},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11981},
	abstract = {Phosphorus donor spins in silicon offer a number of promising characteristics for the implementation of robust qubits. Amongst various concepts for scale-up, the shared-control concept takes advantage of 3D scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) fabrication techniques to minimise the number of control lines, allowing the donors to be placed at the pitch limit of \${\textbackslash}geq\$30 nm, enabling dipole interactions. A fundamental challenge is to exploit the faster exchange interaction, however, the donor spacings required are typically 15 nm or less, and the exchange interaction is notoriously sensitive to lattice site variations in donor placement. This work presents a proposal for a fast exchange-based surface-code quantum computer architecture which explicitly addresses both donor placement imprecision commensurate with the atomic-precision fabrication techniques and the stringent qubit pitch requirements. The effective pitch is extended by incorporation of an intermediate donor acting as an exchange-interaction switch. We consider both global control schemes and a scheduled series of operations by designing GRAPE pulses for individual CNOTs based on coupling scenarios predicted by atomistic tight-binding simulations. The architecture is compatible with the existing fabrication capabilities and may serve as a blueprint for the experimental implementation of a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer based on donor impurities in silicon.},
